# cpp implementation of near-field SAR
A cpp implementation of near-field SAR. The original code is written in MATLAB.

## How to setup

Using armadillo to do matrix/cube transformation and opencv to plot.

Armadillo can be downloaded here http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html.

OpenCV can be downloaded from https://github.com/opencv/opencv. This is the most recent update.

An installation guide can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19671827/opencv-installation-on-mac-os-x.


## The files

### azimuth.cpp
Azimuth.cpp creates a simulated target that consists of 5 spots and processes the target into received signal (S_echo in the .cpp file). The received signal is then computed to reconstruct the target. This .cpp file aims to test and give a simple demo of the construction algorithm.

### generalized_azimuth.cpp 
This is the main program that reconstruct real 2D signal. The signal is stored in 'real2d.txt' and 'imag2d.txt'.

### plotdata.py 
A plotting tool in python as an alternative to opencv. It loads data from 'resulting_image.txt'.

### WK_3D_imaging_experiment.cpp
The main program using WK algorithm to reconstruct 3D signal. The received signal is stored separately in 'secho_real.txt' and 'secho_imag.txt".


## How to play with Azimuth.cpp

1. `g++ azimuth.cpp -o azimuth -O2 -larmadillo` and run `./azimuth` to save the image data into ‘resulting_image.txt’. 

2. Delete the header of ‘resulting_image.txt’ that was generated by the armadillo save function (you can refer to the armadillo docs for detail).

3. ‘python plotdata.py’ to see the resulting image which has 5 bright dots.


## How to play with Generalized_azimuth.cpp

1. (If you have custom received signal stored in a .mat file) use Matlab to get the dimensions of the input data. Then add ‘ARMA_MAT_TXT_FN008 num_row num_col’, as shown in ‘real2d.txt’ and ‘imag2d.txt’. The .cpp program will read ascii from the text files.

2. `g++ generalized_azimuth.cpp -o generalized_azimuth -O2 -larmadillo` and run `./generalized_azimuth` to save the image data into ‘resulting_image.txt’.

3. Delete the header of ‘resulting_image.txt’ that was generated by the armadillo save function (you can refer to the armadillo docs for detail).

4. `python plotdata.py` to see the resulting image.


## How to play with WK_3D_imaging_experiment.cpp

1. (If you have custom received signal stored in a .mat file) use Matlab to load the data and write into a hdf5 file. We are preserving data into hdf5 format because the data is pretty large with over 10 million complex doubles. This amount of data will take armadillo 20 seconds to read if stored in ascii text format.
  1. (In matlab) `h5create('secho_real.h5','/DS1',[200,320,200])`
  2. `dreal = real(secho);`
  3. `h5write('secho_real.h5','/DS1',dreal)`
  4. Repeat the above steps for secho_imag. Feel free to check usage of these functions on Matlab documentation page.

2. In order to enable hdf5 file load/save functionalities: Go to your armadillo folder, inside /include/armadillo_bits/config.hpp, uncomment the line `#define ARMA_USE_HDF5` as specified in http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#config_hpp.

3. You'll also need to install hdf5 library by `brew install homebrew/science/hdf5`

4. `g++ WK_3D_imaging_experiment.cpp -o WK_3D_imaging_experiment -O2 -DARMA_DONT_USE_WRAPPER -DARMA_USE_BLAS -DARMA_USE_LAPACK -DARMA_USE_HDF5 -lblas -llapack -larmadillo -lhdf5` and run `./WK_3D_imaging_experiment` to save reconstructed imaging data into ‘resulting_image.txt’.

5. Delete the header of ‘resulting_image.txt’ that was generated by the armadillo save function (you can refer to the armadillo docs for detail: http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#save_load_mat).

6. `python plotdata.py` to see the resulting image.


## How to run BP_3D_imaging.cpp

1. Follow step 1.2.3 in WK_3D_imaging_experiment.cpp if you haven't run that program first.

2. `g++ BP_3D_imaging.cpp -o BP_3D_imaging -O2 -DARMA_DONT_USE_WRAPPER -DARMA_USE_BLAS -DARMA_USE_LAPACK -DARMA_USE_HDF5 -lblas -llapack -larmadillo -lhdf5` and run `./BP_3D_imaging` to save reconstructed imaging data into 'resulting_image.txt'.

3. Same as the previous programs.


## How to compile if you are using opencv:

`g++ azimuth.cpp 'pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv' -o example1 -O2 -larmadillo`

You'll need to install pkg-config before compiling
